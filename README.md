# WordPress Exporter

This repo is a fork of
https://github.com/SchumacherFM/wordpress-to-hugo-exporter v1.6
that has been modified to produce an export compatible with
my personal static site generator.

I was originally just making Hugo-compatible changes, and you can see
the changelog at the last Hugo-compatible commit, tagged `hugo-last`.
